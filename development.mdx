Step 1. Clone the server to your desired location:

```bash Git Bash
git clone https://github.com/ZenithRPco/ZenithRP game-server
```

Step 2. Go to the newly created `game-server` directory, install all of the NPM packages & open visual studio code.

```bash Git Bash
cd game-server
npm i
code .
```

Step 3. If you have the "Task Runner" extension installed in VSCode, you can simply press "Install Server" in the task list to run the "Install Server" script. If not, then you can do the following

```ps PowerShell
./_scripts/install_server.ps1
```

Step 4. Once the server is installed, if you have the "Task Runner" extension installed in VSCode, you can simply press "Run Server" in the task list to run the "Run Server" script.

```ps PowerShell
./_scripts/run_server.ps1
```

Step 5. You are all done! ðŸŽ‰<br />
To connect to the server, use the "Connect" task or find it in the legacy server browser. If there is a password, you will need to enter it before you can connect. The password is `ZenithRPcoDEV`
